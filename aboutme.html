    <h1>Some things you should know about me</h1>
    <blockquote class="comment">
        My name is Ose Igbinosa, and i am currently studying tech management in ontario tech university,
My interests vary from animation to football, at a younger age I had invested my time into animation including 3d This then allowed me to get seriously interested in video games. Video games allow me to have an escape, it gives room for creativity and that then allows me yo want to do more things. So much so that i have now entered inter mural football games even in university, beating various school teams. I am yet to fully harness my talents but l'm very well on my way
